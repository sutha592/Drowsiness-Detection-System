# Drowsiness-Detection-System
The Drowsiness Detection System alerts users when signs of drowsiness are detected. Using OpenCV and dlib, it captures video, detects faces, and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). If EAR drops below 0.3 for 48 frames, it triggers a warning and sound alert. This system enhances driver safety and prevents accidents.
